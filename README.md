ClojureDart wrapper for Flutter Material widgets, designed to simplify and compact Flutter development in ClojureDart. It provides concise, Clojure-like syntax to work with Flutter’s Material components and types, making code more readable and expressive for Clojure developers building Flutter apps.

## Main Goals

### Provide a more concise and readable UI syntax
The library focuses on simplifying the syntax for building Flutter UIs, making it more compact, intuitive, and aligned with Clojure’s functional style.

### Use Clojure data structures for better consistency and flexibility
The API is designed around pure Clojure types instead of Dart’s, offering a more seamless and consistent experience for Clojure developers while increasing code flexibility.

### Streamline and enhance Dart APIs
The library simplifies certain Dart APIs, making them easier to use and more expressive, improving the overall developer experience.
